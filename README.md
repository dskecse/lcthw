# Practice from Learn C The Hard Way book

## What I will learn

* The basics of C syntax and idioms
* Compilation, make files, linkers
* Finding bugs and preventing them
* Defensive coding practices
* Breaking C code
* Writing basic Unix systems software

## Setup

### Debian

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential

### Fedora

    $ su -c "yum groupinstall development-tools"

### Gentoo

Most packages are already part of the system.

### Mac OS X

In the past it was necessary to install Apple's XCode IDE to get basic tools
like `GCC`, `Git` and `Subversion` on your machine, but nowadays there is a slim
solution by just installing the command line tools:

    $ xcode-select --install
